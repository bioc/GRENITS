Description: The package offers four network inference statistical
        models using Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Gibbs Variable
        Selection: a linear interaction model, two linear interaction
        models with added experimental noise (Gaussian and Student
        distributed) for the case where replicates are available and a
        non-linear interaction model.
